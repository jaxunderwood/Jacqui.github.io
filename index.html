<p class="description">This is a cute little book about a girl who works in her community theater doing set production.  I pulled a couple of pieces from the cover illustration showing the backstage mechanicals to use on the chapter openers. Because this is a mid-grade title I didn't want it to have a lot of design elements, so using the grayscale for the chapter number and bold rounded type for the chapter title combined with the illustration gives it a fun, light feeling.</p>
